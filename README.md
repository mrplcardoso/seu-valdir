# Seu Valdir

Seu Valdir is an elderly man who is bitter about living alone, a consequence of having been a selfish person and mean to others, which pushed everyone away from him, and now he has to deal with this remorse.  
A game to stimulate social awareness and to show that our actions bring consequences for our lives.  
Remake from a game jam (2014), using old assets but refactoring the scenarios, mini games, and finalizing the soundtrack.
